<b>Unikko</b> is a utility mod for Minecraft 1.17.1 and 1.18.1. It's features include Discord Rich Presence and some commands. This mod is mainly for my personal use and learning purposes; don't expect 5-star quality and daily updates.

<b>Unikko does not provide unfair player advantage.</b>

This branch is for Unikko's Minecraft 1.18.1 version.

### Building from source
Clone the repository or download it as a zip file. Run 'gradlew build' with command line in project root folder. unikko-1.18.x-1.x.x.jar should show up in build/libs.

### Downloading Unikko
Releases are provided when I consider the features of that specific version complete and releasable. Releases can be downloaded from https://github.com/jnkyto/Unikko/releases.

That being said, I'd recommend building Unikko straight from sources to get the latest version. In the future I will probably include an easier way to download the latest alpha builds.

### Installing Unikko
1. Install the latest version of Fabric Loader from https://fabricmc.net/use
2. Download the latest version of Fabric API from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api and drag it into %appdata%/.minecraft/mods
3. Drag unikko-1.18.x-1.x.x.jar into %appdata%/.minecraft/mods

### Getting started with Unikko
Type ';help' in chat like a regular Minecraft command for interactive help. More help in [Unikko's wiki page](https://github.com/jnkyto/Unikko/wiki).

### Planned features:
- Player name lookup
- Update DiscordRPC to use GameSDK instead of deprecated libraries.

### inb4FAQ:
1. Is this skidded?
   - Honestly, yes. I don't CTRL+C/V everything though. I try to improve and add stuff to everything I "get inspired" by. Some of the stuff have been made for earlier versions of Minecraft anyway, so they require modification to work again.

2. Why should I install this mod?
    - You probably shouldn't. I mean, there's more useful utility mods out there. The only difference would be that those usually provide unfair player advantage, while Unikko doesn't.
