# Unikko [![build](https://github.com/jnkyto/Unikko/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jnkyto/Unikko/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Unikko is a utility mod for Minecraft 1.17. It's features include Discord Rich Presence and some commands. This mod is mainly for my personal learning purposes; don't expect 5-star quality and daily updates.

1.17 support is not guaranteed. Anarchy servers will probably stay on 1.16.5, hence the mod will be developed for that version only.

### Building from source
Clone the repository or download it as a zip file. Run 'gradlew build' with command line in project root folder. Four .jar files should show up in build/libs. The working mod is the only one without a suffix.

### Installing
1. Install Fabric Loader from https://fabricmc.net/use
2. Download Fabric API from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api and drag it into %appdata%/.minecraft/mods
3. Drag unikko-1.x.x.jar into %appdata%/.minecraft/mods


### Planned features
- Redo module toggling functionality
- More "useful" commands
