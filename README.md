<b>Unikko</b> is a utility mod for Minecraft 1.17.x. It's features include Discord Rich Presence and some commands. This mod is mainly for my personal learning purposes; don't expect 5-star quality and daily updates.

Unikko will be developed mainly for 1.17.x. Changes *may* be occasionally backported to 1.16.5.

### Building from source
Clone the repository or download it as a zip file. Run 'gradlew build' with command line in project root folder. Two .jar files should show up in build/libs. The working mod is the only one without a suffix.

### Installing
1. Install Fabric Loader from https://fabricmc.net/use
2. Download Fabric API from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api and drag it into %appdata%/.minecraft/mods
3. Drag unikko-1.17.x-1.x.x.jar into %appdata%/.minecraft/mods

### Getting started with Unikko
Type ';help' in chat like a regular Minecraft command for interactive help. More help in [Unikko's wiki page](https://github.com/jnkyto/Unikko/wiki).

### Planned features
- Add GUI and means to edit it
- More "useful" commands
